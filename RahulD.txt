Hi, my name is Rahul Desai and I'm a member of the FSW14 cohort. In this alternate reality, I'm patient, satisfied, and adventurous. 

My prior workplace used to ask every new employee 3 questions: favorite movie, favorite vegetable, and spirit animal. In this alternate reality, my favorite movie is Frozen, my favorite vegetable is brussel sprouts, and my spirit animal is a lynx.
